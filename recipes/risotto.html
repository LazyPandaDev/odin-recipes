    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      This mushroom risotto is cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so worth
      it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice
      by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to
      the tooth but not be hard in the center).

    <p>
      Risotto ranks right up there as one of the greatest dishes you can make
      with rice. Originating in Italy, risotto is a recipe made by simmering a
      starchy variety of rice in broth, with flavor-boosting ingredients added
      like onions, garlic, vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese. This
      5-star recipe for mushroom risotto has thousands of ratings and reviews,
      and is a top-rated favorite for our Allrecipes community of home cooks.

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons
          olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello
          and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove
          mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots
          and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated
          with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add
          1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until
          the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite,
          about 15 to 20 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter,
          chives, and Parmesan cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</p>
